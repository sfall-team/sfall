Used from a normal global script if you want to run it at the same point a full hook script would normally run. In case of this function, start proc will be executed in current global script. You can use all above functions like normal. register_hook_proc . void register_hook_proc(int hookID, proc procedure) . The same as register_hook, except that you specifically define which procedure in the current script should be called as a hook (instead of “start” by default). Pass procedure the same as how you use dialog option functions. This IS the recommended way to use hook scripts, as it gives both modularity (each mod logic in a separate global script, no conflicts if you don’t use “hs_*.int” scripts) and flexibility (you can place all related hook scripts for specific mod in a single script!). Use zero (0) as second argument to unregister hook script from current global script. NOTE: you can hook several scripts to a single hook point, for example if it’s different mods from different authors or just some different aspects of one larger mod. In this case scripts are executed in reverse order of how they were registered. When one of the scripts in a chain returns value with set_sfall_return, the next script may override this value if calls set_sfall_return again. Sometimes you need to multiply certain value in a chain of hook scripts. Example: let’s say we have a Mod A which reduces all “to hit” chances by 50%. The code might look like this: . original_chance = get_sfall_arg; set_sfall_return(original_chance / 2); . Mod B also want to affect hit chances globally, by increasing them by 50%. Now in order for both mods to work well together, we need to add this line to Mod A hook script: . set_sfall_arg(0, (original_chance / 2)); . This basically changes hook argument for the next script. Mod B code: . original_chance = get_sfall_arg; set_sfall_return(original_chance * 1.5); set_sfall_arg(0, (original_chance * 1.5)); . So if you combine both mods together, they will run in chain and the end result will be a 75% from original hit chance (hook register order doesn’t matter in this case, if you use set_sfall_arg in both hooks). The defines to use for the hookID are in sfall.h. register_hook_proc_spec . void register_hook_proc_spec(int hookID, procedure proc) . Works very similar to register_hook_proc, except that it registers the current script at the end of the hook script execution chain (i.e. the script will be executed after all previously registered scripts for the same hook, including the hs_*.int script). All scripts hooked to a single hook point with this function are executed in exact order of how they were registered, as opposed to the description below, which refers to using register_hook/register_hook_proc functions. set_sfall_arg . void set_sfall_arg(int argNum, int value) . Changes argument value. The argument number (argNum) is 0-indexed. This is useful if you have several hook scripts attached to one hook point (see register_hook_proc). set_sfall_return . void set_sfall_return(int value) . Used to return the new values from the script. Each time it’s called it sets the next value, or if you’ve already set all return values it does nothing. ",

Returns the object under the cursor on the main game screen. | onlyCritter: . | True - only checks critters and ignores their cover (roof tiles, walls, scenery, etc.) | False - checks all objects (can’t check critters under objects) | . | passing False to the includeDude argument will ignore dude_obj . | NOTE: to get an object located on a tile when the cursor is in movement mode (hexagon cursor), use the tile_under_cursor function | . | . real_dude_obj . sfall.h . ObjectPtr real_dude_obj() . Returns the initial dude_obj after set_dude_obj was used. remove_script . void remove_script(ObjectPtr) . Accepts a pointer to an object and will remove the script from that object. set_dude_obj . sfall.h . void set_dude_obj(ObjectPtr critter) . Take control of a given critter. Passing value 0 will reset control back to “real” dude. set_flags . sfall.h . void set_flags(ObjectPtr obj, int flags) . Sets the current flags of an object. All flags are rewritten with given integer, so first get current flags with get_flags and use bwor/bwand to set/remove specific flag. set_object_data . sfall.h . set_object_data(ObjectPtr object, int offset, int data) . Sets the data at the specified offset of an object. set_script . void set_script(ObjectPtr, int scriptid) . Accepts a pointer to an object and scriptID, and applies the given script to an object (scriptID accept the same values as create_object_sid from sfall 3.6). If used on an object that is already scripted, it will remove the existing script first; you cannot have multiple scripts attached to a single object. Calling set_script on self_obj will have all sorts of wacky side effects, and should be avoided. If you add 0x80000000 to the sid when calling set_script, map_enter_p_proc will be SKIPPED. The start proc will always be run. set_self . void set_self(ObjectPtr) . Overrides the script’s self_obj for the next function call. | It is primarily used to allow the calling of functions which take an implicit self_obj parameter (e.g. drop_obj) from global scripts, but it can also be used from normal scripts. | Will revert back to its original value after the next function call. | Calling self_obj(0) will also revert self_obj to original value. It is recommended to call this after each use of set_self in normal scripts in order to avoid unforeseen side effects. | source_obj, target_obj, and similar functions will not work if preceded by set_self. | NOTE: for use_obj, use_obj_on_obj vanilla functions to work correctly, it is required to call set_self twice. | . set_unique_id . sfall.h . int set_unique_id(ObjectPtr object, int flag) . Assigns a unique ID number to the object and returns it. If a unique ID number has already been assigned to an object, then ID number is returned without reassignment. flag is optional. | items with unique IDs will not stack with other items of the same type in the inventory | to just get the current ID number of an object, use get_object_data(object, OBJ_DATA_ID) | unique ID numbers are saved in your savegame, and have a range from 0x10000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF | there is also a unique ID number range for the player and party members from 18000 to 83535 | to assign a new ID number generated by the engine to the object (i.e. unassign a unique ID), call the function with two arguments and pass -1 for the flag argument | .

    "content": "The sfall build of sslc supports a -O command line option to perform an optimization pass over the generated code. This isn’t a magic make-my-code-go-faster bullet; most of what it does is very limited in scope. It’s primary purpose was to strip out the procedures and variables which get automatically pulled into every script that includes define.h, whether you use them or not, and to do something about the additional variables that get created by foreach loops. There are several levels of optimization available: . | -O1 - Basic, only removes unreferenced globals variables and procedures, code itself remains untouched. | -O2 - Full, most code optimizations are on, but only those that were tested on complex scripts. | -O3 - Experimental, provides most efficiency, but tend to break some complex code due to bugs. | . The following optimizations are performed: . | constant expression folding: if an expression depends only on values which are known at compile time, then the expression is replaced by its result. a:=2+2; -&gt; a:=4; | constant variable initialization: All variables are initialised to some value, (‘0’, if you don’t specify anything else,) so sslc attempts to make use of that fact to remove the first assignment to a variable if the first assignment is a constant expression. variable a; -&gt; variable a:=4; a:=4; -&gt; . | constant propagation: checks for values assigned to variables which can be computed at compile time, and replaces relevent references to the symbol by the constant. The original store is not removed by this optimization. Global variables are considered for this optimization only if they are not marked import or export, and are not assigned to anywhere in the script. a:=4 -&gt; a:=4 foo(a); -&gt; foo(4); . | dead code removal: Checks for and removes code which cannot be reached, either because it is hidden behind a return or because the argument to an if statement can be computed at compile time. if 1 then begin -&gt; display_msg(\"foo\"); display_msg(\"foo\"); -&gt; end else begin -&gt; display_msg(\"bar\"); -&gt; end -&gt; . | unreferenced variable elimination: Checks for variables which are never referenced, and removes them. Also applies to global variables, as long as they are not marked for export. variable i, j, k; -&gt; variable i; i:=1; -&gt; i:=1; return; -&gt; return; . | unreferenced procedure elimination: Checks for any procedures which are never called, and removes them. procedure foo begin return \"foo\"; end -&gt; procedure foo begin return \"foo\"; end procedure bar begin return \"bar\"; end -&gt; procedure start begin procedure start begin -&gt; display_msg(foo); display_msg(foo); -&gt; end end -&gt; . | dead store removal: Removes variable assignments if the result of the variable is unused, and if the expression used to compute the value of the variable is provably free of side effects. (See ‘pure’ keyword) a:=\"moo\"; -&gt; a:=\"foo\"; a:=\"foo\"; -&gt; display_msg(a); display_msg(a); -&gt; a:=\"bar\"; -&gt; . | store combination: Where there are two stores in a row to the same variable, the two expressions are combined. var1 := var2; -&gt; var1 := var2 + var3; var1 += var3; -&gt; . | variable combination: Where usage regions of variables do not overlap, combine the variables to provide additional candidates for unreferenced variable elimination. Very useful for scripts containing multiple foreach loops, which generate 2 or 3 hidden variables each. a:=\"foo\"; -&gt; a:=\"foo\"; display_msg(a); -&gt; display_msg(a); b:=\"bar\"; -&gt; a:=\"bar\"; display_msg(b); -&gt; display_msg(a); . | namelist compression: Fallout stores the names of all file scope variables and procedures in a namelist which is saved into the .int. Any of these that are unreferenced can be removed, and the names of global variables can be modified to make them shorter. | . ",

Not everything needs to be run every single frame. | Never concat constant strings with the ‘+’ operator, as it forces the operation to be done at runtime. The compiler can cope with constant strings being placed next to each other without the need for a +, which results in far more efficient code as the combination is done at lex time. #define GLOB_PREFIX \"ts__\" -&gt; #define GLOB_PREFIX \"ts__\" procedure start begin -&gt; procedure start begin set_sfall_global(GLOB_PREFIX + \"foo1\", 0); -&gt; set_sfall_global(GLOB_PREFIX \"foo1\", 0); end -&gt; end . | Avoid function calls in while loops. function calls are expensive in comparison to variable lookups, so it’s more efficient to move the function call out of the loop and store the result in a variable while i &lt; len_array(array) do begin -&gt; tmp:= len_array(array); ... -&gt; while i &lt; tmp do begin end -&gt; ... -&gt; end . | Mark functions with pure or inline where relevent. ‘pure’ is a hint to the optimizer that a procedure has no side effects. (i.e. there’s no way to tell that it’s been called aside from its return value.) Pure procedures cannot modify global variables, or call any other procedure that isn’t itself pure. Functions marked with pure can only be used in expressions (i.e. you cannot use the call &lt;procedure&gt; syntax to call them.) If there are non-pure terms in an expression, it prevents that expression being considered for dead store removal. Where no such optimizations can be performed, or if optimization is disabled, marking a procedure with pure will have no effect on the compiled code. ‘inline’ is an instruction to the compiler to replace calls to the marked procedure with a copy of the procedures code instead of having a seperate call. inlined procedures cannot use the ‘return’ command, cannot be predefined, and cannot be used as part of an expression. inlining if a procedure is only going to be called once is always a win, but if there are multiple calls to a procedure you will end up bloating the size of the generated code. | .

ObjectPtr create_spatial(int scriptID, int tile, int elevation, int radius) . Creates new spatial script with given SID, at given tile, and radius. game_loaded . int game_loaded() . Returns 1 the first time it is called after a new game or game load, and 0 any time after. It works on an individual basis for each script, so one script wont interfere with others.

Returns the current AP cost to access the inventory in combat . get_kill_counter . int get_kill_counter(int critterType) . get_light_level . int get_light_level() . Returns ambient light level in range 0..65536. The value returned by get_light_level may not exactly match that set by set_light_level, as set_light_level applies modifiers from the Night Vision perk. get_npc_level . int get_npc_level(string npc) . get_proto_data . int get_proto_data(int pid, int offset) . Used to read the in-memory copies of the .pro files Fallout makes when they are loaded.

Takes a party member PID or an NPC name (deprecated, for compatibility with sfall 4.1.5/3.8.15 or earlier) as an argument. The NPC must be in your party. This function ignores player level requirements and the minimum 3 player level delay between NPC level gains. It also ignores the random element, regardless of sfall’s NPCAutoLevel setting. input_funcs_available . int input_funcs_available() .

Effects all critters rather than just the player and can set the maximum in range from 0 to 999. set_pipboy_available . void set_pipboy_available(int available) . Will only accept 0 or 1 as an argument. Using any other value will cause the function to have no effect. Use 0 to disable the pipboy, and 1 to enable it. set_proto_data . void set_proto_data(int pid, int offset, int value) . Used to alter the in-memory copies of the .pro files Fallout makes when they are loaded. The offset refers to the offset in memory from the start of the proto to the element you are reading. Changes are not stored on disc, and are not permanent. If you modify the protos, and then Fallout subsequently reloads the file your changes will be lost. set_unspent_ap_bonus . void set_unspent_ap_bonus(int multiplier) . Alters the AC bonus you receive per unused action point at the end of your turn in combat. To allow for fractional values, the value given if divided by 4. (Hence the default value is 4 and not 1.) . set_unspent_ap_perk_bonus . void set_unspent_ap_perk_bonus(int multiplier) .

This is a modified copy of sslc, that has a few bugfixes from the original, that will recognise and compile the additional scripting functions provided by sfall, that can also understand some additional syntax, and that has an integrated preprocessor and optimizer. Unlike the original script compiler, this has not been compiled as a dos program. When using this in place of the original compile.exe but still using p.bat, you need to either get rid of the dos4gw.exe reference from p.bat or replace the original dos4gw.exe with the one in this archive. If you use fallout script editor, you can extract compile.exe and dos4gw.exe to its \\binary folder, or extract them somewhere else and change your preferences in FSE to point there. FSE doesn’t seem to be able to tell when errors occur when using this compiler though, so I’d recommend either using sfall’s script editor instead or compiling by hand if possible. When compiling global or hook scripts for sfall 3.4 or below, you must include the line procedure start; before any #includes that define procedures to avoid a few weird problems. (this is no longer required starting from 3.5) . This version of compiler was designed primarily for new sfall functions, but it can safely (and is recommended) to be used with non-sfall scripts as well, as long as you don’t use any of the arrays syntax and any sfall scripting functions.

    "content": "Syntax which requires sfall for compiled scripts to be interpreted, is marked by asterix (*). | Optional arguments in user-defined procedures. You can only use constants for default values. It basically puts those constants in place of omitted arguments. | new: procedure test(variable x, variable y := 0, variable z := -1) begin ... end ... call test(\"value\"); . | old: procedure test(variable x, variable y, variable z) begin ... end ... call test(\"value\", 0, -1); . | . | New logical operators AndAlso, OrElse for short-circuit evaluation of logical expressions. Using these operators allow the right part of logical expressions not to be evaluated (executed, computed) if the result is already known. This can improve the performance of running scripts. Example: if (obj andAlso obj_pid(obj) == PID_STIMPAK) then ... If obj is null, the second condition will not be checked and your script won’t fail with “obj is null” error in debug.log . This also has an effect that a value of last computed argument is returned as a result of whole expressions, instead of always 0 (false) or 1 (true): . obj := false; display_msg(obj orElse \"something\"); // will print \"something\" . You can also use the -s option to enable short-circuit evaluation for all the AND, OR operators in the script. NOTE: Be aware that it may break some old scripts because operators behavior is changed slightly. | Conditional expressions (Python-inspired), also known as ternary operator: . | new: X := value1 if condition else value2 . | old: if (condition) then X := value1; else X := value2; . | . | To assign values, you can use the alternative assignment operator from C/Java instead of Pascal syntax. | new: x = 5; . | old: x := 5; . | . | Multiple variable declaration: Multiple variables can be declared on one line, seperated by commas. This is an alterative to the ugly begin/end block, or the bulky single variable per line style. | new: variable a, b, c; . | old: variable begin a; b; c; end . | Variable initialization with expressions: You can now initialize local variables with complex expressions instead of constants. | new: variable tile := tile_num(dude_obj); . | old: variable tile; tile := tile_num(dude_obj); . NOTE: if your expression starts with a constant (eg. 2+2), enclose it in parentheses, otherwise compiler will be confused and give you errors. | . | Hexadecimal numerical constants: Simply prefix a number with 0x to create a hexadecimal. The numbers 0 to 9 and a-f are allowed in the number. The number may not have a decimal point. | new: a := 0x1000; . | old: a := 4096; . | . | Increment/decrement operators: ++ and -- can be used as shorthand for +=1 and -=1 respectively. They are mearly a syntactic shorthand to improve readability, and so their use is only allowed where +=1 would normally be allowed. | new: a++; . | old: a += 1; . | . | break &amp; continue statements: they work just like in most high-level languages. break jumps out of the loop. continue jumps right to the beginning of the next iteration (see for and foreach sections for additional details). | new: while (i &lt; N) begin // ... if (/* some condition */) then break; // ... end . | old: while (i &lt; N and not(breakFlag)) begin // ... if (/* condition */) then breakFlag := true; // ... end . | new: for (i := 0; i &lt; N; i++) begin // ... if (/* condition */) then begin // action continue; end // else actions end . | old: for (i := 0; i &lt; N; i++) begin // ... if (/* condition */) then begin // action end else begin // else actions end end . | . | for loops: Another piece of syntactic shorthand, to shorten while loops in many cases. Parentheses around the loop statements are recommended but not required (when not using parentheses, a semicolon is required after the 3rd loop statement). | new: for (i := 0; i &lt; 5; i++) begin display_msg(\"i = \"+i); end . | old: i := 0; while (i &lt; 5) do begin display_msg(\"i = \"+i); i++; end . NOTE: continue statement in a for loop will recognize increment statement (third statement in parentheses) and will execute it before jumping back to the beginning of loop. This way you will not get an endless loop. | . | switch statements: A shorthand way of writing big if then else if... blocks . | new: switch get_attack_type begin case ATKTYPE_PUNCH: display_msg(\"punch\"); case ATKTYPE_KICK: display_msg(\"kick\"); default: display_msg(\"something else\"); end . | old: variable tmp; tmp := get_attack_type; if tmp == ATKTYPE_PUNCH then begin display_msg(\"punch\"); end else if tmp == ATKTYPE_KICK then begin display_msg(\"kick\"); end else begin display_msg(\"something else\"); end . | . | empty statements in blocks are allowed: This is just a convenience to save scripters a bit of memory. Some of the macros in the fallout headers include their own semicolons while others do not. With the original compiler you had to remember which was which, and if you got it wrong the script would not compile. Now it’s always safe to include your own semicolon, even if the macro already had its own. For example, this would not compile with the original sslc, but will with the sfall edition: #define my_macro diplay_msg(\"foo\"); procedure start begin my_macro; end . | Procedure stringify operator @: designed to make callback-procedures a better option and allow for basic functional programming. Basically it replaces procedure names preceeded by @ by a string constant. Not many people know that since vanilla Fallout you can call procedures by “calling a variable” containing it’s name as a string value. There was a couple of problems using this: . | optimizer wasn’t aware that you are referencing a procedure, and could remove it, if you don’t call it explicitly (can be solved by adding making procedure “critical”) | you couldn’t see all references of a procedure from a Script Editor | it was completely not obvious that you could do such a thing, it was a confusing syntax | old: callbackVar := \"Node000\"; callbackVar(); . | new: callbackVar := @Node000; callbackVar(); . | . | *arrays: In vanilla fallout arrays had to be constructed by reserving a block of global/map variables. Since sfall 2.7, specific array targeted functions have been available, but they are fairly messy and long winded to use. The compiler provides additional syntactic shorthand for accessing and setting array variables, as well as for array creation. When declaring an array variable, put a constant integer in []’s to give the number of elements in the array. (before sfall 3.4 you had to specify size in bytes for array elements, now it’s not required, see “arrays.txt” for more information) . | new: procedure bingle begin variable a[2]; a[0] := 5; a[a[0] - 4] := a[0] + 4; display_msg(\"a[0]=\" + a[0] + \", a[1]=\" + a[1]); end . | old: procedure bingle begin variable a; a := temp_array(2, 4); set_array(a, 0, 5); set_array(a, get_array(a, 0) - 4, get_array(a, 0) + 4); display_msg(\"a[0]=\" + get_array(a, 0) + \", a[1]=\" + get_array(a, 1)); end . | . | *array expressions: sometimes you need to construct an array of elements and you will probably want to do it in just one expression. This is now possible: . | new: list := [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"]; . | old: list := temp_array(4, 2); list[0] := \"A\"; list[1] := \"B\"; list[2] := \"C\"; list[3] := \"D\"; . Syntax specific for associative arrays is also available. (see “arrays.txt” for full introduction to this type of arrays). | . | *map array expressions: map := {5: \"five\", 10: \"ten\", 15: \"fifteen\", 20: \"twelve\"}; . | . | “dot” syntax to access elements of associative arrays. “dot” syntax allows to work with arrays like objects: trap.radius := 3; trap.tile := tile_num(dude_obj); . You can chain dot and bracket syntax to access elements of multi-dimensional arrays: . collectionList[5].objectList[5].name += \" foo\"; . | . NOTE: when using incremental operators like +=, *=, ++, -- compiler will use additional temp variable to get an array at penultimate level in order to avoid making the same chain of “get_array” calls twice. | . | foreach loops: A shorthand method of looping over all elements in an array. Syntax is foreach (&lt;symbol&gt; in &lt;expression&gt;). | new: procedure bingle begin variable critter; foreach (critter in list_as_array(LIST_CRITTERS)) begin display_msg(\"\"+critter); end end . | old: procedure bingle begin variable begin critter; array; len; count; end array := list_as_array(LIST_CRITTERS); len := len_array(array); count := 0; while count &lt; len do begin critter := array[count]; display_msg(\"\" + critter); end end . If you want an index array element (or key for “maps”) at each iteration, use syntax: foreach (&lt;symbol&gt;: &lt;symbol&gt; in &lt;expression&gt;) . foreach (pid: price in itemPriceMap) begin if (itemPid == pid) then itemPrice := price; end . If you want to add additional condition for continuing the loop, use syntax: foreach (&lt;symbol&gt; in &lt;expression&gt; while &lt;expression&gt;). In this case loop will iterate over elements of an array until last element or until “while” expression is true (whatever comes first). | . NOTE: just like for loop, “continue” statement will respect increments of a hidden counter variable, so you can safely use it inside foreach. | . ",

You can use this to search for a substring in a string like this: strlen(get_array(string_split(haystack, needle), 0)) . string_to_case . string sfall_func2(\"string_to_case\", string text, int toCase) . Converts all letters in the given string to the specified case. toCase: 0 - lowercase, 1 - uppercase . NOTE: this function works only for English letters of A-Z/a-z. strlen . int strlen(string text) . Returns string length. substr . string substr(string, start, length) . Cuts a substring from a string starting at “start” up to “length” characters. The first character position is 0 (zero). | If start is negative - it indicates starting position from the end of the string (for example substr(\"test\", -2, 2) will return last 2 charactes: “st”). | If length is negative - it means so many characters will be omitted from the end of string (example: substr(\"test\", 0, -2) will return string without last 2 characters: “te”). | If length is zero - it will return a string from the starting position to the end of the string New behavior for sfall 4.2.2/3.8.22 | .
